Here we have code for generating the data used to make SI FigS8.

The computations were performed on OIST's sango cluster.

The data is saved into the data release for the paper, in a section called "infomap_tau_sweep_data". 

The results of these computations are used in Dynamics_of_dominance/figures_code/fig5_and_SI8_SI9.ipynb.

The necessary infomap utility functions can be found in figures_code/lib/infomap_utils.py.
